# ErrorXVI Fitness App
 I've lately decided to start working on my body, but I dont really like the calorie trackers that I find online, rather I usually use my notes instead. I've also found myself going back and forth between different apps and websites for calculations. So i figured why not just create an all in one app. But I'll start with baby steps and do each part separate for now.
